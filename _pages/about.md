I am a data scientist passionate about solving complex problems and creating value from data. I have experience in finance and media, developing and deploying data products using Python, machine learning, and data engineering. 

I have also worked as a freelancer with international clients and as a researcher at UFSM, where I founded a machine learning Club. I work at Grupo RBS, where I integrate data science into the company culture and help improve millions of users' digital experiences. 

I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies and collaborate with other data science professionals. If you'd like to connect with me, please send me a message or an invitation.
